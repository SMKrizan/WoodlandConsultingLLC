## Description 

Our team were commissioned by WoodlandConsulting LLC to create an interactive website to increase web visibility and bring in new leads. We worked with the owner Jessica Walther to identify Woodland Consulting's needs and brand while researching her competitors to understand the lighting field and where we could add features to set her business apart. The final website features an intuitive and simple admin dashboard for retrieving messages and updating information on the site, while the client side display's her work with a focus on the breadth and depth of her experience.
